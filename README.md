# Secret of Spas

## ðŸ“– Description
Secret of Spas is a single-player RPG that unfolds in the quiet village of Mogilovo.

Spas, an old man known for his love of drinking, wakes up to a terrible discoveryâ€”his precious stash of alcohol has been stolen. Desperate to recover it, he enlists the help of Kuncho, a spirited 20-year-old from the village.

Spas makes Kuncho an intriguing offer: if he can track down the thief and reclaim the stolen stash, he will reveal to him the ultimate secret of life.

Now, itâ€™s up to Kuncho to embark on this unusual quest, uncovering mysteries and facing unexpected challenges along the way.

## ðŸ“– Missions
In Secret of Spas, missions are assigned by mysterious figures known as Snitches.

Each Snitch is an NPC with valuable information about the burglar, but they wonâ€™t share it for free. In exchange for clues, they demand a favor from Kuncho.

Every Snitch operates within a single game map, offering a unique mission that Kuncho must complete before uncovering the next piece of the puzzle.
